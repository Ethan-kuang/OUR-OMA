What is OUR-OMA?
-------------

OUR-OMA employs a finite element approach to extract the J-integral from digital 
image correlation (DIC) and digital volume correlation (DVC) measured displacement fields. 
OUR-OMA has been developed in python and runs inside Abaqus via its scripting interface.

The DIC/DVC measured displacement fields are imported as a set of full field boundary conditions 
into a finite element model of the crack. The location of the crack 
tip and mouth in the displacement field must be known and specified in the code. A region 
around the crack, chosen by the user, is then re-meshed with higher order elements for improved accuracy. 
The user selects another region larger than the first re-meshed area, which is free from boundary conditions, 
to allow for more realistic material response/deformation. The J-integral around the crack is then computed using 
 a user defined number of contours.

Dependencies
------------

OUR-OMA is coded in Python and runs inside the Abaqus software (preferably Abaqus 6.14 or more recent) 
via its scripting interface. The code requires numpy, which comes pre-built with the Abaqus python scripting API.

Installation
-------------

The file is simply saved into the same directory as the displacement field to be evaluated.
To run enter 'abaqus cae noGUI=filename.py'. The full path must be included in filename.
