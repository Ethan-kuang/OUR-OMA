What is OUR-OMA?
-------------

OUR-OMA employs a finite element approach to extract the J-integral from digital image and digital volume corrwlation measured displacement fields. The displacement fields are imported as a set of full field boundary conditions into a finite element model of the crack. A software tool coded in Python facilitates this, and runs inside the Abaqus software via its scripting capability.
